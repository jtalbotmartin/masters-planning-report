### project specification

ideas
	- cancer syndromes - mechanism breakdown
	- accumulation of specific mutations lead to a mutational signature - shows us the origin of the tumour
	- number of patients that have this signature that points to a specific origin
	- but these patients are without a genetic diagnosis
	- hypothesis: using mutational signatures to define a patient cohort of BRCA-mutation presenting patients, who are without a genetic diagnosis
	- will lead to finding near-coding genetic diagnoses that have been previously missed in searches
- state clearly what the project is intended to deliver
- aims and objectives of work
- hypotheses of work

### ethical analysis

--
- ethical basis
- background
- implications of the project in regards to:
  -  subjects used
  -  their provenance
  -  data derived
  -  their use
-  long term effects and meaning of the work
-  effects of the work on colleagues, the college, society and the environment as appropriate

### literature review
- key finds from a range of published sources
  - used to identify research gaps
  - shape aims and objectives
  - justify decisions you are making in methodology
- clear text, using figures if helpful
### implementation plan
- breakdown of work already done
- work to be done in time remaining on the project
  
- identify a set of milestones
- provide a realistic estimate of when each should be completed (if all goes well)
- detail fallback positions in case any stage of the development goes wrong
- keep track and revise initial estimates as time goes on to ensure finish in time
### evaluation
- detail how you expect to measure the success of your project
- in particular, document tests required to ensure deliverables function correctly
- ...as well as, where appropriate, experiments required to evaluate the work with respect to other products / research results

### preliminary results
- details of the progress you've made thus far (long descriptions are for the final report)
