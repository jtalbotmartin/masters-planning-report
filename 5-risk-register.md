Owing to the nature of an entirely computationally based project, the scope of risks involved in my work are limited.

In particular, risks can be broadly categorised as pertaining to the research risks - pertaining to the data contained on GEL's research environment, and practical risks pertaining to the success of my project objectives.

Most significantly to the patients involved in the study, there is a significant risk of data breach unless sensible data security mitigations are in place: these were detailed in my GEL information governance training - such as the setting of strong passwords, ensuring my laptop is locked when I am away from my desk, and being vigilant of phishing emails.

A risk to the safety of my own work is posed by the necessity of storing data only on GEL's research environment - thereby not being able to access standard means of data-backup. In the event of an error with GEL's infrastructure, this data could be lost, or misplaced. Thus, sensible mitigation is in the diligent documentation of my work, and the frequent exportation of my findings, so I can keep local copies.

In terms of project delivery, the primary risk is of not completing the necessary steps to achieve my aims in time. As a mitigation, I have developed a sensible and flexible implementation plan, and meet weekly to discuss progress and ensure I am on track.
