Regardless of positive or negative results, success is defined in this project by robust inferences of the initial research question - requiring diligent data extraction, critical analysis and intelligent interpretation, based on the methodology I have articulated. Cross-referencing results against established statistics as a sanity check, and validating results with expert collaborators in the Computational Rare Disease Genomics and Nik-Zainal research groups [63, 64] will strengthen these analyses. However, with positive results, the experimental validation of results - although unlikely to be achievable in the timescale of my work on the project - is possible. For example, in reaching out to a clinician to enquire about accessing promoter methylation data to verify biallelic inactivation of BRCA1 or BRCA2, or by utilising a functional assay to validate impacts of uncovered variants.
