### data and security

- data used[[5-risk-register]]
	- GEL research environment
		- secure, centralised
			- localised analyses on platform
			- can't export any identifiable data
		- unable to take data
	- nature of that data (sensitive, confidential)
	- what data exists on there
		- genomic, health records
	- steps taken to protect sensitive data
		- pseudonym
	- ensure consent
		- participants sign up
		- ability to withdraw consent
	- other things GEL does
- however, potentially identifiable information

### researcher responsibility
- data responsibility
	- limitations to anonymisation - potentially identifiable information on there
	- required to sign agreement to {}, including not attempting to identify
	- take training on information governance
	- participant data can't be removed - need to ensure using most up to date patient lists, updated after consent revoked
- responsibility in interpretation
	- robust inferences - incorrect inferences and disclosure could lead to negative impacts on number of stakeholders:
		- patient - potentially life-altering findings, needs to be right
		- clinician and society - wasted time and public resources


### ethics of project aims
- align with / satisfy set of principles in medical research - declaration of helsinki
	- {} / declaration principles
	- {} / definition of ethics to apply?
- align with set of ethical principles of general life / research?
- project approval
	- written application stating the purpose of the project
	- admitted into GeCIP
	- approval by patient panel
- published on genomics England (RE GECIP)

### impact
- patient
	- explanation of the cause of their disease, potential implications for future treatment
- family
	- screening for variant, emprowers clinical decisions and interventions
- society
	- increased understanding of disease biology
	- in case of negative result - ruling out a source of potential explanation
- research community
	- publish

### questions
- ethical question around disclosure to patient recruited for a separate rare disease, who actually has this>
- discretion of clinician
