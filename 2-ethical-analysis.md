### data and security

In this project, I will analyse patient data in the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project (GEL) dataset. Contained within the GEL dataset are the genomic information of over a hundred thousand voluntary participants, in addition to extensive medical records and other associated data that is extremely sensitive, confidential and private. This data is accessed only via a secure, centralised research platform on which users perform all analyses, and from which researchers are unable to take any data that could be deemed identifiable: in essence, only the analytical results from studies can be extracted, after undergoing an approval process.

To protect the privacy of patients, steps have been taken to protect sensitive data, through de-identification and robust systems of security. [58]
To ensure patient autonomy, participation is entirely voluntary and participants can fully or partially withdraw form the programme at any time. [60]

### researcher responsibility

Whilst Genomics England has taken all possible steps to ensure the protection of confidential data, individual researcher responsibility is still required. For example, despite all possible effort to de-identify patient data, the detail contained in medical records can be identifiable, and researchers must sign an agreement before acceptance onto the Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnership (GeCIP), including a commitment to not re-identification of patient data.
In addition, researchers must undergo training in information governance and security before approval. [62]
Furthermore, data from the GEL platform cannot be removed for patients who have withdrawn consent, It is then the responsibility of the researcher to ensure their patient cohorts are the most up to date, excluding participants who revoked consent. 
Important researcher responsibility in generating sound and robust analyses are paramount. Incorrect inferences would lead to extremely harmful impacts on a patient level via clinical action based on misinformation, and on the level of clinicians, health services and society  - via discrediting clinical judgement, eroding patient/public trust, and in the misuse of public resources.

### ethics of project aims

The aims and objectives of this project satisfy the World Medical Association's Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects, the Declaration of Helsinki. [61] A detailed research plan was also approved by an access review committee and published on GeCIP Research Registry, in part to ensure the work was in accordance with appropriate data use principles, promote collaboration, and prevent duplication of research. Access to the research environment was granted, overseen by the GEL participant panel made up of individuals represented in the GEL dataset, who advice the Genomics England board.

One particularly murky area of ethical territory avoided in the use of GEL data, is with regards to the findings that I could uncover in this project. In the situation where genetic risk is uncovered in patients recruited to the GEL cohort for an unrelated disorder, the question of wherther to disclose this knowledge to the patient divides opinion. In this instance however, GEL has already serveyed patients on whether they would consent to receiving additional findings. [59]

### impact

In this study, downstream impacts of positive results are hugely beneficial to patients and their families, through the provision of a genetic diagnosis with which to screen family members for the an uncovered mutation, should they so wish. Gaining an explanation for causes of genetic disease, understanding risk of disease, and being best placed to make informed clinical and personal decisions on that basis are of profound significance to patients.
On a research and societal level, small findings can increase, or broaden our understanding of disease biology in subtle ways - through positive or negative results, a similarly positive impact.
