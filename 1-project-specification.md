### hypotheses

- cancer syndromes - mechanism breakdown
- accumulation of specific mutations lead to a mutational signature - shows us the origin of the tumour
- number of patients that have this signature that points to a specific origin
- but these patients are without a genetic diagnosis
- hypothesis: using mutational signatures to define a patient cohort of BRCA-mutation presenting patients, who are without a genetic diagnosis
- will lead to finding near-coding genetic diagnoses that have been previously missed in searches
