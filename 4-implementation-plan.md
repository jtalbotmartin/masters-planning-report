- breakdown of work already done
- work to be done in time remaining on the project
  
- identify a set of milestones
- provide a realistic estimate of when each should be completed (if all goes well)
- detail fallback positions in case any stage of the development goes wrong
- keep track and revise initial estimates as time goes on to ensure finish in time
